									<h3 class="major">An Andriod Application for Tracking Combat</h3>
									<p>This application is written in java using Andriod by myself and a colleague, Rolin Buckoke. The purpose of this application is to track the combat turn order of the players and their opponents, otherwise known as initiative. It can apply any relevant modifiers to their order that would speed up or slow down their character's reaction time. For example, you can put the status "wading through water" on a player or monster, which will result in the subject's turn occurring later in the round. The system is designed to be used for the second edition of dungeons and dragons, which was released in the late 80s, as there were no suitable alternatives that I could find. </p>

									<p>Rolin Buckoke is responsible for creating the original framework for adding players/monsters and tracking the player's initiatives and their status'. My contributions to the project can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/rolinb/InitiativeTracker/commits/master">commit log</a>. The primary features I implemented are the reworked add players/enemies features, clearing enemies and changing player names, ending combat sequence, and various aesthetic enhancements.</p>
